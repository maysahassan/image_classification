# Image_classification Project: 

## Skin cancer image classification

The aim of this project is to classify the skin cancer images into its types.

The model classifies the images into the seven types of skin cancer -

1_ Actinic keratoses
2_ Basal cell carcinoma
3_ Benign keratosis
4_ Dermatofibroma
5_ Melanocytic nevi
6_ Melanoma
7_ Vascular lesions

This project uses transfer learning methods using mobilenet pretrained model for mole image classification.

## Required Libraries

Tensorflow
Keras
Numpy

## To run the project run the deployment code my_UI whic will load the model then you can upload any mole image so it will detect which category and have the result
